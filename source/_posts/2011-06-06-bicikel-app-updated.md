As karma has it, the Bicikel app had a pretty noticeable bug after being released - if the phone took some time to lock its location, the station list did not sort correctly. Also, the full station map view didn't really show any useful information beyond the station position.

So now I released [Bicikel 1.1 for Android][2] with bugfixes and new station list and map coloring, so the user can see stations that are either full or empty at first glance.

New station list and map view:

Additional fixes and enhancements follow :)
