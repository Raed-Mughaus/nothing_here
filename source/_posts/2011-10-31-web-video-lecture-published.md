About a week ago [Webcamp Ljubljana][1] happened and among other awesome web-related knowledge I've also given an overview lecture on what do you need to encode, stream and play video on the web.

The lecture mostly outlines current web format war, different methods of video delivery and different methods of playing videos. The lecture was given in Slovenian language and is [available on Webcamp.si videos site][2].

All [WebcampLJ videos][3] are hosted by us ([Viidea ;)][4]) and I very much recommend seeing them, they contain several gold nuggets of knowledge.
