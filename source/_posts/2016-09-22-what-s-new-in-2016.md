It's been awfully quiet around here, to the point where the last post made is more than a year ago. In the meantime I did not disappear from the face of the earth, but have been busy with putting together the Android and C++ part of the [PSPDFKit SDK](https://pspdfkit.com/). My year was filled with writing blogs and talks there as well. 

# DroidCons

I talked about how to implement cross-platform development across Android, iOS, Linux, Windows and OS X with C++ and all the challenges that come from that. The talk was given on [DroidCon Zagreb 2016](http://droidcon.hr/en/sessions/taming-ndk-dragon-cross-platform-development-0) and [DroidCon Berlin 2016](https://droidcon.de/en/sessions/taming-ndk-dragon-cross-platform-development).

The talk was titled "Taming the NDK dragon for cross-platform development" and these are the slides:

The audio recording from DroidCon Berlin is available on [VoiceRepublic](https://www.voicerepublic.com/talks/taming-the-ndk-dragon-for-cross-platform-development).

# Blogs

Meanwhile, I've helped write a pair of blog posts on PSPDFKit blog as well:

* [The curious case of Android premultiplied alpha](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2016/a-curious-case-of-android-alpha/)
* [Just a simple bookmark](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2016/just-a-simple-bookmark/)

The [PSPDFKit Blog](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/) is full of other interesting tid-bits and information for mobile developers, so certanly don't stop at only my rants there :)
