Some time ago I had a [lecture in Kiberpipa][1] about 3D game engine history titled "From Doom to Crysis" (*Od Pogube do Krize*) with some very nice demonstrations and anecdotes of modern 3D game engines and their older counterparts.

The video is now available on [Kiberpipa video archive][2] with slides [available on Slideshare][3] (I suggest downloading original pptx file for embedded videos). The lecture is in Slovenian language.
