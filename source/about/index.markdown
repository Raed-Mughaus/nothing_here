# Jernej *"Mavrik"* Virag

Software developer, gamer, debater and professional flamewar starter. Pacify with great quantities of ice-cream or chocolate.

My primary expertise lies in knowledge of video processing (having several years experience with transcoding and publishing systems) and mobile development on Android.

My poisons of choice are Java, C and Python, however I also have pracical experience in software development with web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS), C#, MatLab and Objective-C for iOS.
